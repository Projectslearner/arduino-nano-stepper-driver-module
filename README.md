# Stepper Driver Module

#### Project Overview

The Stepper Driver Module project demonstrates how to control a stepper motor using an Arduino Nano and a stepper driver module. Stepper motors are widely used in applications requiring precise and controlled rotational motion, such as 3D printers, CNC machines, and robotics.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Stepper Motor**
3. **Stepper Driver Module**
4. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Stepper Motor to Stepper Driver Module:**
   - Connect the stepper motor's four wires (coil wires) to the four output terminals of the stepper driver module. The sequence of connections depends on the motor type (bipolar or unipolar) and driver module.
   
2. **Connect Stepper Driver Module to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the step pin of the stepper driver module to pin 2 on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the direction (dir) pin of the stepper driver module to pin 3 on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the ground (GND) pin of the stepper driver module to a ground (GND) pin on the Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the stepper motor and stepper driver module to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, the stepper motor will rotate clockwise and counterclockwise for 100 steps each, with a 1-second delay between rotations.
   - Monitor the motor's rotation to ensure it behaves as expected.

#### Applications

- **Positioning Systems:** Use stepper motors to precisely control the position of mechanical components in various systems.
- **Motion Control:** Implement stepper motors in applications requiring controlled and repeatable motion, such as robotic arms and linear actuators.
- **3D Printing and CNC:** Stepper motors are integral components in 3D printers, CNC machines, and other automated manufacturing systems.

#### Notes

- Adjust the delay in the code to control the speed of the motor's rotation.
- Modify the number of steps and direction of rotation as needed for your specific application.
- Ensure the stepper motor's voltage and current ratings are compatible with the stepper driver module to prevent damage to the components.
